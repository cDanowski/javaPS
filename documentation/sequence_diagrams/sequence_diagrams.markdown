Sequence Diagrams demonstrating dynamic Interaction
---------------------------------------------------

Within the sub-pages various sequence diagrams are depicted to demonstrate the interactions between the main components of JavaPS. The presentation is split into two main sections:

-	an [abstract workflow description](/workflow_general/general_workflow.markdown) that demonstrates the main steps from any WPS request to its response. It is independent from concrete WPS operations.
-	the [workflow descriptions of all WPS 2.0 operations](/workflow_general/workflow-of-wps-200-operations), which reveals details on request validation and handling for each of the WPS operations.
